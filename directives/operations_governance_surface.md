# Operations & Governance Surface Impact

## Directive contract

- **Target sources:** canonical Scheduler manifest and wrappers, managed-service registry, LLM and eval registries, issuer/source policy, typed runtime receipts, bounded database observations, schema compatibility, and separately governed operator capabilities.
- **Output schema:** an explicit disposition of `primary surface`, `linked governed view`, or `deliberate exclusion`, plus the affected typed registry/snapshot/view models and evidence-backed tests.
- **Refresh cadence:** declared configuration is projected at application start; request snapshots use the panel cache contract; runtime state comes only from typed receipts or bounded read-only observations with their own recorded time and freshness policy.
- **Logical Idempotency Key:** canonical owner identity plus the required surface disposition. Repeating a projection for the same owner/disposition must not create a second logical surface item.
- **Content Identity:** digest of the typed registry, receipt, or snapshot payload used by the projection.
- **Observation Version:** registry/snapshot version, evidence-recorded time, and observed-at time.
- **Attempt Identity:** unique application-start projection or request snapshot invocation and its receipt.
- **Rate-limit budget:** zero network calls, subprocess probes, service-control calls, or unbounded filesystem/database reads in the Operations render path. Live producers write bounded receipts outside the request path.
- **Failure-mode policy:** render Missing, Stale, Invalid, or Unavailable with evidence source and time. Never turn absent or malformed evidence into a healthy claim, and never block unrelated product work merely because an internal implementation detail is not an operator workflow.

## Outcome

The Operations & Governance workspace remains a truthful operator-facing map as functionality is added, removed, renamed, or changes ownership. It is not an inventory of every module or CLI. It shows supported operations, their declared ownership, current evidence, freshness, failure state, and guarded actions at the level needed to understand or operate the product safely.

## Trigger matrix

Run this review when a change affects any of the following:

| Change | Required review |
|---|---|
| Scheduler task, wrapper, cadence, enabled state, job identity, write lane, or service ownership | Confirm the dynamic Jobs projection, receipt identity, and freshness remain truthful. |
| Supported manual or managed-service operation | Declare ownership, run/failure state, and whether an operator action is supported. |
| Source/provider pull, telemetry, rate limit, retry, backlog, or circuit | Confirm recent health, completeness, failure, and evidence-time visibility. |
| LLM purpose, model route, budget, eval, cost, latency, fallback, or failure telemetry | Confirm the linked LLM governance view remains complete and attributable. |
| Queue, lock, service, backup, restore, WAL, incident, or notification behavior | Add current evidence or state that the observation is unsupported/unavailable. |
| Migration that changes operational telemetry, receipts, retention, provenance, or recovery | Confirm expected/actual schema and recovery meaning. Ordinary business-schema migrations need only a no-surface-change reason. |
| Approval, retry, one-off run, enable/disable, apply, or other operator mutation | Apply the Operator-action boundary below. |
| Removal or rename of any supported item above | Apply the Removal contract below. |

Pure implementation refactors, test-only changes, prose-only changes, and internal CLIs that are not supported operator workflows may use `no surface change`, but the reason must name the preserved contract. Do not scan every Flask route or `execution/*.py` file and treat it as a product capability.

## Projection and display contract

1. **Project from owners.** Extend canonical owners and adapters first. `src/operations/registry.py` compiles Scheduler tasks/wrappers, services, LLM/eval definitions, source policy, queue states, and the expected Alembic head. Do not copy current task names, purpose names, providers, routes, or schema heads into this directive or the renderer.
2. **Observe without side effects.** `src/operations/snapshot.py` may use only the caller-owned read-only connection and bounded typed receipts/files. Configuration, registration, historical execution, current runtime state, and freshness are separate facts.
3. **Disposition every domain.** Each material `OperationsRegistry` and `OperationsSnapshot` field has exactly one disposition in `src/pipeline/operations_panel.py`: a visible primary tab, a linked governed view, or a deliberate exclusion with a reason. Adding or removing a model field must fail the surface-completeness test until reviewed.
4. **Render truthful states.** A visible observation includes status/value, observed time, evidence-recorded time when available, safe evidence label, and complete empty/loading/missing/stale/invalid behavior. An empty successful read says that no records were found; it does not say healthy.
5. **Keep attention complete.** Any visible bad, invalid, stale, stopped, failed, blocked, or otherwise action-requiring governance state contributes to the headline attention model unless a tested rationale explicitly makes it informational.
6. **Keep linked views governed.** A linked diagnostic may satisfy the disposition only when it is reachable from the Operations workspace, uses the governed loader, and preserves the same truthfulness and sanitization boundaries.

## Removal contract

Removing or renaming functionality requires all of the following in the same coherent change:

- remove or update the canonical owner and typed projection;
- remove obsolete cards, rows, controls, links, copy, filters, and attention rules;
- keep retained historical evidence distinguishable from an active capability;
- test that the retired identity is absent and that no orphan route or action remains;
- preserve a truthful unavailable/deprecated state only when historical interpretation still requires it.

## Operator-action boundary

Observability does not authorize mutation. A control appears only when the underlying capability has its own authorization, validation, idempotency/concurrency contract, bounded execution, durable receipt, loading/error/retry state, and applicable confirmation. Destructive, enabling/disabling, production-write, or broad-run controls require their separate security and activation review. If any prerequisite is absent, render read-only status or an explicit unsupported state instead of a button.

## Required evidence

At minimum, record one Pull Request disposition and run the relevant set. The Pull Request block is a reviewer/agent checklist; CI does not parse checkbox selection. The deterministic guards are the owner-equality and surface-disposition tests below.

- `tests/test_operations_registry.py` for exact projection from canonical owners;
- `tests/test_operations_snapshot.py` for bounded read-only evidence, freshness, and fail-closed states;
- `tests/test_operations_panel.py` for surface dispositions, attention, sanitization, actions, accessibility, and responsive structure;
- `tests/test_comments_server_operations.py` and `tests/test_work_os_shell.py` for route/cache/loader behavior;
- the full `tests/test_ui_controls.py` for any rendered frontend change;
- browser acceptance for a visible or interactive change: primary navigation, each affected state, 375px and desktop layouts, keyboard/focus behavior, network completion, and a clean console.

A tested `no surface change` disposition must state which canonical owner and visible contract remain unchanged. Static configuration, a green subprocess, or a successful historical row is not current-health evidence.
